# Sustainable-Power-Generation-Challenge-2023
This repo contains material for the first SES Projects Challenge 2023

## Goals
As the world transitions from fossil fuels to renewable energy, solar energy has proved to be the most promising alternative and photovoltaics the most developed method of extraction. However, solar energy will not be enough to meet the current energy demand. To meet the ever increasing demand, we have to exploit all energy resources available to us such as wind, wave, hydro, and tidal sources.
In kenya, while the government has done a great deal in increasing the energy supply, access to energy is still a major concern especially in rural areas. Thus there is an increasing need for off grid energy sources to supply these areas. 
The goal of the challenge is to come up with a small scale, off-grid power generation system relying on renewable sources aside from solar photovoltaics. The system should be able to provide adequate energy to cover the basic energy needs of a small home eg. lighting, heating, food preservation, entertainment, etc. Each team is to carry out an engineering design and simulation research to evaluate the effectiveness of the system. Environmental factors such as time-based and regional flactuations of the energy source are to be accounted for. 

## Team Registration
Each team should have at most 4 members.

## Selection criteria
Each teams design will be judged on 4 main categories:
+ Functionality - How well does the solution address the problem
+ Manufacturing cost
+ Ease of maintenance
+ Originality

The categories are listed in order of importance. 

## Project Deliverables
Each team is to provide the following deliverables:
+ A written project proposal covering design and simulation 
+ CAD files of the system
+ Simulation files for the system

## Documentation and Collaboration
1. Teams should clearly state reasons for their design choices in the proposal.
2. Teams are encouraged to fork this repo and use it to track their progress.
3. Other collaboration tools such as GRABCAD are encouraged for easy sharing of CAD files. 


## Challenege Timeline
The challenge runs from 16th January 2023 to 3rd February 2023.
